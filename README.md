# [A computational model for gestalt proximity principle on dot patterns and beyond](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772625)

## 1. Introduction
* reconstruction the continous structure from dot patterns; 
* proposed extended tolerance space theory;
* proposed one-reach and two-reach computational model for Gelstalt principles.
* revealed this model is the extention of Pure Distance Low.

## 2. How to use
* run ``DemoSecorder.m``
* then you can find all figures (including one-reach and two-reach results).
